ZisaCore is a minimal collection of functionality without which the other
libraries can't be written. Most notably it includes logging, file and string
related functions. As well as abstractions for the CUDA related function
decorations (`__device__` and friends). In and of itself it is of little
interest to anyone.

## Quickstart
Start either by heading over to one of the more interesting libraries

   * [ZisaMemory](https://github.com/1uc/ZisaMemory)

or by reading the [API documentation](https://1uc.github.io/ZisaCore).
